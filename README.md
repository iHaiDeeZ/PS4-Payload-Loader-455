## Summary
In this project you will find a full implementation of the "bpf" kernel exploit for the PlayStation 4 on 4.55. It will allow you to run arbitrary code as kernel, to allow jailbreaking and kernel-level modifications to the system. This release however, *does not* contain any code related to defeating anti-piracy mechanisms or running homebrew. This exploit does include a loader that listens for payloads on port `9020` and will execute them upon receival.

This bug was discovered by qwertyoruiopz, and can be found hosted on his website [here](http://crack.bargains/455/).

## Features
1) Payload Auto-Loaded Via Kernel Exploit
2) PS4Hen & Full Debug Settings 
3) Automatic Refresh if Exploit fails.  ```(	window.location.reload(1); }, 5000);) ```
4) Coming Soon.

**No Need to use Netcat.**
